# Hoare Logic: An Introduction
## What is Hoare Logic?

- A formal system for reasoning about program correctness.
- Uses **Hoare triples** of the form
 
$$
\{ P \} C \{ Q \}
$$
  
where:

- $P$ is the **precondition** (what must be true before execution).
- $C$ is the **command** (the program to execute).
- $Q$ is the **postcondition** (what is guaranteed after execution).

---

# Hoare Triples: Meaning

- **Example:**
  
$$
\{ x = 2 \} x := x + 1 \{ x = 3 \}
$$

- Before executing $x := x + 1$, $x$ is 2.
- After execution, $x$ is guaranteed to be 3.

- This ensures **partial correctness**: If the program terminates, $Q$ holds.

# The Axioms and Rules of Hoare Logic

## Assignment Rule

If $P$ holds after replacing $x$ with $E$, then $P$ holds after assignment.

$$
\{ P [x := E] \} x := E \{ P \}
$$


### Example

$$
\{ y + 1 = 5 \} x := y + 1 \{ x = 5 \}
$$


# The Rules (Continued)

## Consequence Rule

If $P'$ implies $P$, and $Q$ implies $Q'$, then the triple is valid.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \} C \{ Q \}, P' \rightarrow P, Q \rightarrow Q' 
}{
\{ P' \} C \{ Q' \}
}
$$


---

## Composition Rule

If $C1$ ensures $Q$ and $C2$ ensures $R$, then their sequence ensures $R$.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \} C1 \{ Q \}, \{ Q \} C2 \{ R \}
}{
\{ P \} C1; C2 \{ R \}
}
$$

---

# Hoare Logic for Conditionals

## If-Else Rule

The postcondition $Q$ holds regardless of which branch executes.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \wedge B \} C1 \{ Q \}, \{ P \wedge \neg B \} C2 \{ Q \}
}{
\{ P \} \text{if $B$ then $C1$ else $C2$} \{ Q \}
}
$$

### Example:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\{ x > 0 \} \\
\text{if $x > 0$ then $y := x$ else $y := 0$} \\
\{ y \ge 0 \}
\end{array}
$$

# Hoare Logic for Loops

## **5. While Loop Rule**

```
{ P ∧ B } C { P }
-------------------------
{ P } while B do C { P ∧ ¬B }
```

- **Loop invariant** `P` remains true before and after each iteration.
- Ensures correctness of loops by proving invariance.

---
# Example: Proving a Simple Loop

### **Program:**
```
{ x = n, y = 0 }
while x > 0 do
  y := y + 1;
  x := x - 1
{ y = n }
```

### **Loop Invariant:**
```
{ x + y = n }
```
- Initially true (`y = 0`, `x = n` → `x + y = n`).
- Maintained after each iteration.
- When loop exits (`x = 0`), `y = n` holds.

---
# Summary

- **Hoare Logic** allows formal reasoning about program correctness.
- Uses **Hoare triples** `{ P } C { Q }` to specify behavior.
- Key rules:
  - Assignment
  - Composition
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
- Loop invariants are crucial for proving correctness.

# Hoare Triples: Meaning

- **Example:**
  
  ```
  { x = 2 } x := x + 1 { x = 3 }
  ```
  
  - Before executing `x := x + 1`, `x` is 2.
  - After execution, `x` is guaranteed to be 3.

- This ensures **partial correctness**: If the program terminates, `Q` holds.

# The Axioms & Rules of Hoare Logic

## **1. Assignment Rule**

```
{ P[x := E] } x := E { P }
```

- If `P` holds after replacing `x` with `E`, then `P` holds after assignment.

Example:
```
{ y + 1 = 5 } x := y + 1 { x = 5 }
```

# The Rules (Continued)

## **2. Consequence Rule**

```
{ P } C { Q }, P' ⇒ P, Q ⇒ Q' 
-----------------------------------
{ P' } C { Q' }
```

- If `P'` is stronger than `P`, and `Q` implies `Q'`, the triple remains valid.

## **3. Composition Rule**

```
{ P } C1 { Q }, { Q } C2 { R }
-----------------------------------
{ P } C1; C2 { R }
```

- If `C1` ensures `Q` and `C2` ensures `R`, then their sequence ensures `R`.

# Hoare Logic for Conditionals

## **4. If-Else Rule**

```
{ P ∧ B } C1 { Q }, { P ∧ ¬B } C2 { Q }
------------------------------------------------------
{ P } if B then C1 else C2 { Q }
```

- The postcondition `Q` holds regardless of which branch executes.

Example:
```
{ x > 0 }
if x > 0 then y := x else y := 0
{ y ≥ 0 }
```
