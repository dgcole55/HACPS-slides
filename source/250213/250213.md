# Hoare Logic: An Introduction
## What is Hoare Logic?

- A formal system for reasoning about program correctness.
- Uses **Hoare triples** of the form
 
$$
\{ P \} C \{ Q \}
$$
  
where:

- $P$ is the **precondition** (what must be true before execution).
- $C$ is the **command** (the program to execute).
- $Q$ is the **postcondition** (what is guaranteed after execution).

# Hoare Triples: Meaning
  
$$
\{ x = 2 \} ( x := x + 1 ) \{ x = 3 \}
$$
or
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\{ x = 2 \} \\
 x := x + 1 \\
 \{ x = 3 \}
\end{array}
$$

- Before executing $x := x + 1$, $x$ is 2.
- After execution, $x$ is guaranteed to be 3.

# The Axioms and Rules of Hoare Logic

## Assignment Rule

If $P$ holds after replacing $x$ with $E$, then $P$ holds after assignment.

$$
\{ P [x := E] \} x := E \{ P \}
$$


### Example

$$
\{ y + 1 = 5 \} x := y + 1 \{ x = 5 \}
$$


# The Rules (Continued)

## Consequence Rule

If $P'$ implies $P$, and $Q$ implies $Q'$, then the triple is valid.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \} C \{ Q \}, P' \rightarrow P, Q \rightarrow Q' 
}{
\{ P' \} C \{ Q' \}
}
$$


---

## Composition Rule

If $C1$ ensures $Q$ and $C2$ ensures $R$, then their sequence ensures $R$.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \} C1 \{ Q \}, \{ Q \} C2 \{ R \}
}{
\{ P \} C1; C2 \{ R \}
}
$$

---

# Hoare Logic for Conditionals

## If-Else Rule

The postcondition $Q$ holds regardless of which branch executes.

$$
\frac{
\{ P \wedge B \} C1 \{ Q \}, \{ P \wedge \neg B \} C2 \{ Q \}
}{
\{ P \} \text{if $B$ then $C1$ else $C2$} \{ Q \}
}
$$

### Example:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\{ x > 0 \} \\
\text{if $x > 0$ then $y := x$ else $y := 0$} \\
\{ y \ge 0 \}
\end{array}
$$

# Hoare Logic for Loops

## While Loop Rule

$$
\frac{
\{ P \wedge B \} C \{ P \}
}{
\{ P \} \text{while $B$ do $C$} \{ P \wedge \neg B \}
}
$$

- **Loop invariant** $P$ remains true before and after each iteration.
- Ensures correctness of loops by proving invariance.

# Example: Proving a Simple Loop

### Program:

```
{ x = n, y = 0 }
while y < n do
  y := y + 1;
  x := x - 1
{ y = n }
```

### Loop Invariant:
```
{ x + y = n }
```

- Initially true (`y = 0`, `x = n` → `x + y = n`).
- Maintained after each iteration.
- When loop exits (`x = 0, y = n`) holds.

# Summary

- **Hoare Logic** allows formal reasoning about program correctness.
- Uses **Hoare triples** $\{ P \} C \{ Q \}$ to specify behavior.
- Key rules:
  - Assignment
  - Composition
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
- Loop invariants are crucial for proving correctness.
