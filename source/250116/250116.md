# Lessons Learned

## **Avoid Verifying Existing Code**
- Verifying existing systems is more challenging than co-developing a system alongside its correctness proof.
- Verification experts must decipher required properties from complex codebases and documentation.
- Systems co-developed with proofs allow developers to make choices that facilitate easier verification.

---

## **Focus on Critical Code**
- Only verify the parts of the system whose correctness is essential for security.
- Partitioning systems into critical and non-critical code can simplify verification efforts.
- Example: Leveraging the **seL4 microkernel** enabled the HACMS Air Team to sandbox unverified code securely.

---

## **Eliminate Obvious Bugs First**
- Use low-cost testing tools to remove straightforward bugs before formal verification.
- This reduces the verification effort by focusing on unusual corner cases.
- Verification tools are more efficient when systems are pre-screened for common issues.

---

## **Leverage Automation**
- Use decision procedures such as **SAT** and **SMT solvers** or tactic libraries to automate portions of the verification process.
- Automation facilitates updating proofs when system changes occur.
- Expanding automation capabilities and improving tactic libraries are ongoing research goals.

---

## **Adopt Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**
- Write code in DSLs designed to support verification, which simplifies proof generation.
- DSLs can simultaneously produce executable code and associated proof scripts.
- These languages reduce complexity and improve the integration of proofs into system development.

<!--------------------------------------->

# Domain-Specific Languate Example

## ReWire and FPGAs

**ReWire** is a purely functional language for creating secure hardware designs that can be implemented on FPGAs. The ReWire language is a subset of Haskell that places some restrictions on the use of recursion. The ReWire compiler `rwc` translates ReWire programs into synthesizable VHDL.

**VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is a hardware description language that can model the behavior and structure of digital systems at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from the system level down to that of logic gates, for design entry, documentation, and verification purposes.

## ReWire

\scriptsize
```haskell
data Bit        = Zero | One
data W8         = W8 Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit

plusW8 :: W8 -> W8 -> W8
{-# INLINE plusW8 #-}
plusW8 = nativeVhdl "plusW8" plusW8

zeroW8 :: W8
zeroW8 = W8 Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero

oneW8 :: W8
oneW8 = W8 Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero One

start :: ReT Bit W8 I ()
start = begin

begin :: ReT Bit W8 I ()
begin = loop zeroW8 oneW8

loop :: W8 -> W8 -> ReT Bit W8 I ()
loop n m = do b <- signal n
              case b of
                  One  -> loop n m
                  Zero -> loop m (plusW8 n m)
```

  - Finds subtle issues overlooked by intuition or conventional testing.
  - Addresses corner cases in large-scale systems.

---

## **Spectrum of Formal Methods**
### **Tool Categories**:
1. **Type Systems**:
   - Examples: 
        - Statically typed:  Haskell, C.
        - Dynamically typed:  Python, Matlab

---

## Examples of Static Type Systems in C

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declaring an integer variable
    int number = 10;

    // Declaring a string (character array) variable
    char text[] = "Hello";

    // Attempting to assign a string to an integer variable
    number = "World"; // Error: incompatible types

    printf("Number: %d\n", number);
    printf("Text: %s\n", text);

    return 0;
}
```

## Example of Dynamic Type System in Python

```python
number = 10          # Variable can hold any type
number = "World"     # No error; type can change at runtime
```

```haskell
let rec fibonacci (n:nat)
  : nat
  = if n <= 1
    then 1
    else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)

val fib_greater_than_arg (n:nat {n >= 2})
  : Lemma (fibonacci n >= n)
  
let rec fib_greater_than_arg (n:nat {n >= 2})
    : Lemma (fibonacci n >= n)
    = if n = 2 then assert(fibonacci 2 >= 2)
