# Goals and Motivation

- Showcase **KOS libraries** and **core apps**
- Demonstrate **Elixir** and **Scenic** in KOS systems
- Illustrate tools for **building and deploying** KOS systems  

---

# System Overview

Runs on:

- BeagleBone Black (BBB)
- Sensor
    - **BME280 sensor**
    - **ARM QEMU simulator** (fake sensor)

Uses **KOS Poukai manifest** + 3 user-level apps  
- Weather sensor
- Weather station
- I2C

# Core KOS Apps

**KOS-installed Apps:**

- `self_test`: performs a series of tests on startup
- `admin`: Erlang BEAM VM
    - coordinates admin activities (restart, upgrade), 
    - client to a Kry10 Server
- `key_store`: a way to store secrets, private keys, that aps can get at runtime
- `ethernet`: ethernet driver and implements the ethernet protocol to provide access to apps
- `tunnel`: secure communication to host machine (typically Studio server)
- `rng_server`: random number generator for cryptographic security
- `log_server`: system-wide logging*

---

# User-Level Apps

- `weather_sensor`: Reads **BME280 sensor**, controls **LED**
- `weather_station`: **GUI app** using **Scenic** (Elixir framework)  

- `i2c`: **I2C driver** for BeagleBone Black (not on QEMU)

---

# `weather_sensor` App

Contains a driver for the sensor and has a protocol to provide current sensor readings and to control an LEDS on the BBB.

- **BME280 driver**
- **GPIO control** for LED  
- **I2C Server** for sensor communication

---

# BME280 Driver

- Location: `weather_sensor/src/am335x`  
- Configuration: `resources.dti`  

**Communicates via I2C**

- Reads temperature, humidity, pressure
- Uses **GPIO** to control LED  

---

# QEMU Virtual Sensor

Location: `weather_sensor/src/qemu-arm-virt`  

**Emulated sensor:**

- Returns **static values** instead of real readings
- Simulates LED **on/off messages**
- **Does not use I2C**  

---

# Weather Protocol

Defined in `weather_protocol/weather_protocol.h`  

Supported Messages:

- Read sensor data
- Turn LED ON
- Turn LED OFF

---

# Scenic

Scenic is an application framework written directly on the Elixir/Erlang/OTP stack. With it, you can build client-side applications that operate identically across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux, and more.

Scenic is primarily aimed at fixed screen connected devices (IoT), but can also be used to build portable applications.

# Scenic GUI (Elixir)

**Elixir-based UI** for displaying sensor data  
Built using Scenic Framework

Communicates with:

- `weather_sensor` (retrieves sensor data)
- Remote GUI via Kry10 Server
- Device LED control

---

# Admin Server & Kry10 Server

Admin server handles:

- Restart, upgrade operations
- WebSocket-based command-and-control commands (from Kry10 Server)  

Kry10 Server Authentication

- Uses **public/private keypair**
- Secure **challenge-response** handshake  

---

# Remote Management

Kry10 Server:

- Manages **connected KOS devices**
- Provides **web-based remote access**
- **Secure tunnels GUI traffic**  

Client functions:

- Restart (`system_restart`)
- Upgrade (`system_upgrade` via URL)  

---

# Secure Tunnel & Ethernet

Uses **BoringTun** (WireGuard® VPN)  
Enables encrypted off-device communication

Network Flow:

1. `tunnel` app → encrypts data
2. `ethernet` server → routes data
3. Kry10 Server decrypts & relays

---

# Summary

- KOS system design for IoT & embedded  
- Uses **Elixir, Scenic, I2C, GPIO, TLS tunnels**  
- Secured admin access via **Kry10 Server**
